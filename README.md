## Next...
### Mechy keyboard

I've found some similar apps however I couldn't find any that fits for me.
- **Mechvibes** it's probably the most complete solution but:
  - It's an electron app.
  - I want an small and resource efficient app.
  - Key up sound doesn't exist (at the moment)
  - Doesn't have a mute shortcut (at the moment)
- **Rustyvibes** it's built on Rust, its a terminal app but:
  - I want a friendly way of downloading soundpack
  - I don't want to do extra steps like manually download the soundpack and converting it to another format.
  - And I want it as a standalone app, I don't want to keep the terminal open to enjoy the sounds.
- **KeyEcho** almost fit all my needs but:
  - Does not play any sound on key up

 In general all the mentioned apps don't feel realistic. I want to add some distinctive feature to stand out from the rest.

### Firecannon
HTTP (also websockets maybe) stress test
- Number of threads
- Open connections
- Very customizable http payload (body, headers, methods, content-types, timeouts)
- Duration
- Simulate traffic spikes
- Beatiful graphs (https://ui.shadcn.com/charts)
- Create stats with responses

### Semantic file system

Sometimes you need to search a document, image, song or sounds and you don't remember where or which was the file name.

Building a global semantic filesystem can be really hard so I will learn:

- How to use AI to undestand file contents and create a bunch of tags.
- How to process and store a large amount of gigabytes of data.
- How to index all the tags, files and data.
- Fundamental databases concepts
- Multi-threading
- Low level concepts like disk pagination, files formats, metadata
